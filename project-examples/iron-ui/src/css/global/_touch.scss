/**
 * Avoid 300ms click delay on touch devices that support the `touch-action` CSS property.
 *
 * In particular, unlike most other browsers, IE11+Edge on Windows 10 on touch devices and IE Mobile 10-11
 * DON'T remove the click delay when `<meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width'>` is present.
 * However, they DO support removing the click delay via `touch-action: manipulation`.
 * See:
